# Climate Change Impacts on Indigenous and Afro-descendant Lands (Master Project)

This repository contains data and analysis related to the impact of climate change on the well-being of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities living on traditional lands in Brazil.  
The analysis explores the interactions between climate-related risks, land use, and socio-environmental outcomes.
