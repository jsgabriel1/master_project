# Master Project
 This repository contains data used to analyze the impact of climate change on the well-being of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities living on traditional lands. The analysis focuses on the interplay between climate-related risks, land use perspectives, and their socio-environmental effects. Organized by Jos√© Gabriel M. da Cruz.
